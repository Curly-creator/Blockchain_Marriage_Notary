# Smart Contract Notary

## Description
Marriage Notary using Smart Contract on Ethereum Blockchain. - A STUDENT PROJECT -

## Installation
To run the notary we highly recomment to use a test enviroment. Below you'll find a list of Tools we used for our development.

**!!! Don't use real Ether, there is no guarantee to get it back !!!**

[Solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity): Ethereum Solidity Language for Visual Studio Code

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Python Language

[Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/): virtual Blockchain

[Ganache-Cli](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/ethereum-and-clients/ganache-cli/): Commandline integration for Ganache

[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable): Client Server

[Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html): Smart Contract Development Platform

[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/): Cryptho Wallet and Gateway to Blockchain-Apps. Used to handle Accounts and Transactions.

## Setup

To run the Marriage Notary in the test enviroment you have to install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/), [Ganache-Cli](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/ethereum-and-clients/ganache-cli/), [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) and [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). 

Make sure every component is installed correctly.

**1. Connect your local Ganache with Brownie by typing the following command into your commandline.**

brownie networks add Ethereum ganache-local host="_RPC-SERVER_" chainid:"_CHAIN_ID_"

_RPC-SERVER_: RPC-Server of your local Ganache. Default should be http://127.0.0.1:8545

_CHAIN_ID_: Network Id of your local Ganache. Default should be 1337

**2. Connect your Ganache to MetaMask and import an account.**

To do so, follow this [Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv4HEyiw4EQ). Make sure to import account[0]. Currently this is the only account that can interact with the Smart Contract.

**3. Install npx and Yarn by typing the following command into your commandline.**

npm install -g npx
npm install --global yarn

**4. Deploy the Smart Contract to your local Ganache-Blockchain. Therefore type the following command into the commandline.**

brownie run sripts/deploy.py --network ganache-local

**5. Start the WebApp by typing the following command into your commandline.**

yarn start

**!! You might need to restart the Terminal before it works !!**

## Usage

**1. Creating a new Marriage Contract**

Enter Marriage-Deatails into the Input-fields and press the _Submit_. On the right side a list of all created Marriages will be displayed.

_Wallet Address of the couple has to be a Wallet-Address from your local Ganache_

_Marriage Date hast to be in the following format: DDMMYYYY_

**2.Get Marriage Details**

Enter the Adress of a couple you want to get the Details from into _Adress of the couple_ and press _Get Details_. All the available Details will be displayed below.

**3.Ring the Bells**

By rining the bells you can send Ether to the Marriage Contract. Enter the Address you want to send Ether to into _Wallet Address of the couple_ and the amount of Ether into _Number of Wei's._

_Note: 1 Ether = 1e18 Wei_

**4.Withdraw**

To withdraw ether from the Smart Contract enter your Wallet-Address into _Wallet Address of the couple_ and press _Withdraw Ethers_.

_Note: Only the married couple can withdraw their ether. Currently you can only withdraw with account[0]. So make sure to use the right address._


## To do

- At the moment you can interact only with one account (account[0]) from local ganache) with the notary. 
Hardcoded in [App.js](client\src\App.js) in ringBell- and withdraw-function.

- Copybutton in Marriage List is currently not working
